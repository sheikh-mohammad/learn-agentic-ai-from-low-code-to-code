Here’s a practical, non-coding syllabus which we are running as a 5-week cohort (8 x 2–3h sessions) or we will also offer it as a 2-day intensive in Companies and Universities. It stays hands-on with AgentKit’s visual tools—no programming required.

## No-Code Agents with OpenAI AgentKit — Course Syllabus

## Course overview

Build, test, and ship a production-ready AI agent using OpenAI’s new AgentKit—focusing on the visual Agent Builder, governance & guardrails, built-in evals, and one-click chat UI embedding with ChatKit. By the end, learners publish a working agent and a simple plan to measure impact and iterate. ([OpenAI][1])

### Who it’s for

Non-programmers (general managers, accountants, engineers, doctors, financial managers, product managers, ops, Customer Experience (CX), Human Resources / Learning & Development (HR/L&D), consultants, educators, everyone) who can define workflows and business outcomes, but don’t want to write code.

### What you’ll build

A capstone agent of your choice—for example:

* Customer support triage & answer bot
* Research & brief generator for sales/BD
* Internal knowledge assistant (policies/SOPs)
* Classroom co-teacher / onboarding guide

---

## Learning outcomes

By the end, participants can:

1. Understand the concepts of Agentic Web and Agentic Organizations
2. Describe core agent concepts (agents, tools, handoffs, sessions, guardrails) in plain language and map them to business workflows. ([OpenAI GitHub][2])
3. Use **Agent Builder** to design multi-step workflows on a visual canvas, version them, and add approvals/guardrails without code. ([OpenAI][1])
4. Connect knowledge safely (files/connectors) and set up the **Connector Registry** with admins. ([OpenAI][1])
5. Deploy a branded chat experience with **ChatKit** and share it with test users. ([OpenAI][3])
6. Measure and improve quality with **Evals** (datasets, trace grading, prompt optimization), and understand when to consider reinforcement fine-tuning. ([OpenAI][1])
7. Apply **Guardrails** for safety (PII masking, jailbreak detection, hallucination checks) using the wizard and presets. ([OpenAI GitHub][4])

## Format & pacing

* **6 weeks** · **2 sessions/week** · **2–3 hours/session** (+ extra Question/Answer Sessions)
* **Alt**: **2-day bootcamp** covering the same modules with condensed labs to be offered in Companies and Universities
* Delivery: live workshop or flipped classroom (short videos + guided labs)

## Detailed Schedule

### Week 1 — Agentic Web and Organizations 

**Session 1: [Agentic Web](./00_agentic_web/readme.md) (2h)**

**Session 2: [Agentic Organizations](./01_agentic_org/readme.md) (2h)**

### Week 2 — AI and Human Readiness & No-Code Agents first workflow

**Session 3: [AI and Human Readiness](./02_ai_and_human_readiness/readme.md) (2h)**

* Assignment 1 Real AI Agents Reserach Discussion
* Introduction to AI Agents

**Session 4: [What is an “agent” (no code)?](./03_no_code_agents/readme.md) (2h)**

* The AgentKit stack at a glance: Agent Builder (visual), Connector Registry (admin), ChatKit (UI), Evals (quality), Guardrails (safety).
* Concepts in human terms: tasks, tools, multi-step flows, agent handoffs, memory/sessions.
* Demo tour of Agent Builder: canvases, nodes, versions, templates; publish/preview lifecycle.
  
  **Lab:** Clone a template, customize instructions, add an approval step, run test conversations. ([OpenAI][1])

### Week 3 — Knowledge Connectivity & Design Patterns

**Session 5: Connecting knowledge safely (2–3h)**

* What to put in vs. link to; file search basics; connector options (e.g., Drive, SharePoint, Teams) and MCP servers.
* Data handling patterns: least-privilege, redaction, auditability.
  
  **Lab:** Attach a small policy pack (PDFs/Docs), configure retrieval, and test relevance safely. ([OpenAI][1])

**Session 6: Visual design patterns (2–3h)**

* Drag-and-drop nodes: tools, file search, guardrails, decision/branching, human-in-the-loop.
* Multi-agent patterns via handoffs—when and why to split responsibilities.
* Versioning & change logs; rollback and safe launches.
  
  **Lab:** Build a 5–7 node workflow from a blank canvas; add a human approval and a fallback path. ([OpenAI][1])

### Week 4 — Evaluations, Branding the Chat UI & Deployment

**Session 7: Deploy with ChatKit (2h)**

* Shipping a usable interface without front-end work: embed options and theme/brand tweaks.
* Sharing with pilot users; capturing transcripts and feedback for iteration.
  
  **Lab:** Deploy your agent’s chat UI, set a custom name/avatar, and invite 3 pilot testers. ([OpenAI][3])

**Session 8: Evals you’ll actually use (2–3h)**

* Designing a simple eval dataset from real tickets/prompts.
* **Trace grading**: grading whole runs to spot brittle steps.
* **Prompt optimization**: generate improved prompts from grader + human annotations.
* Third-party model comparisons (what, why, when).
  
  **Lab:** Create a 20-case eval, run it, and apply one optimization round. Re-run and compare. ([OpenAI][1])

### Week 5 — Quality: Guardrails, Observe, Governance and Iterate

**Session 9: Observability & cost control (2h)**

* Reading traces; identifying tool-call loops and dead ends.
* Lightweight A/Bs: instruction tweaks and guardrail thresholds.
* When RFT helps (conceptual only) and how to scope an RFT request with your tech team.
  
  **Lab:** Use traces to remove one redundant step and reduce tokens/time per task. ([OpenAI][1])

**Session 10: Guardrails & governance (2–3h)**

* The **Guardrails Wizard**: select checks (moderation, jailbreak, PII, hallucinations) and set policies—no code.
* Human approvals & audit trails; rollout controls and change management.
  
  **Lab:** Add PII masking + jailbreak detection to your agent, document your policy, and re-test. ([OpenAI GitHub][4])

### Week 6 — Capstone

**Session 11: Capstone build & publish (2–3h)**

* Finalize workflow, run evals, harden guardrails, and polish the ChatKit UI.
* Write a one-page “launch note”: scope, metrics, SLAs, rollback plan.
  
  **Capstone demo:** 5-minute live run + Q&A; submit your Launch Note and a 14-day iteration plan.

---

## Assessments & deliverables

* **Checkpoints (30%)**: Session labs (Builder, connectors, evals, guardrails).
* **Capstone (50%)**: Working agent, embedded chat UI, eval results, safety config.
* **Launch Note (20%)**: Clear goals, success metrics, and iteration plan.

---

## Tools & accounts (no coding needed)

If you want, I can tailor this to a specific audience (e.g., support orgs, schools, or consulting firms) and pre-fill the Builder templates for that track.
