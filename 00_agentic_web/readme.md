* **AgentKit:** A **drag-and-drop workflow builder** (plus Python) to create goal-oriented agents that call APIs, tie into enterprise systems, ship embeddable chat components, and run **evaluation** for agent accuracy. Think Zapier/Lindy-style tooling **inside** ChatGPT.
* **Model access:** Expanded APIs for **GPT-5 Pro** (reasoning) and **Sora 2** (video); **GPT-5 Codex** is GA with **Slack integrations** and enterprise controls.

### Why it matters

* Positions OpenAI as both **consumer platform** and **developer ecosystem**—roles akin to iOS/Android, but **conversation replaces clicks**.
* Could consolidate fragmented user flows (brainstorm → design → check licensing → share) **inside one chat**.
* If it sticks, ChatGPT becomes a **new gateway to the web**, shifting discovery, commerce, and UI patterns from pages/tabs to **threads/prompts**.

### Friction & risks the article flags

* **Control & gatekeeping:** OpenAI sits between users and the web; raises **privacy, interoperability, and platform power** concerns.
* **Security & data handling:** Third-party apps/agents inside chat introduce **new privacy risks**; trust and review processes are critical.
* **Lock-in for devs:** Policies/monetization could constrain developers—echoes of mobile app stores.
* **Regulatory heat:** A “gatekeeper” conversational platform may face **DMA-style scrutiny**.
* **Adoption unknowns:** People may not want to **live entirely** in ChatGPT; earlier “custom GPTs” fizzled.
* **Competitive pressure:** OpenAI courts developers while **Google, Anthropic, Amazon** vie for them; **Meta/DeepSeek** push strong **open-source** options.

### Notable quotes/stance

* **Nick Turley (ChatGPT product):** “We **never meant to build a chatbot**; we meant to build a **super assistant**.” He doesn’t expect users to spend all day in ChatGPT—more like **start in ChatGPT, then branch to apps/sites**.

### Bottom line

Dev Day 2025 is OpenAI’s bid to own the **next interface of the internet**. If successful, **apps move from tabs to threads**, and “search” evolves into **conversation**—but questions about **openness, privacy, and platform control** are just beginning.

These announcements are more than just incremental updates; they represent a strategic move to position OpenAI's technology as the foundational layer of the next-generation internet. The vision, as articulated by experts and gleaned from OpenAI's direction, is one where users no longer need to navigate a complex web of websites and apps. Instead, they will interact with a single, intelligent agent that can understand their needs and orchestrate a variety of services to fulfill them.

### The Dawn of an Agent-Centric Internet

This new paradigm, often referred to as the "agent-centric" or "post-app" web, promises a more intuitive and personalized online experience. Imagine telling your AI assistant to "plan a weekend trip to the coast for my family," and having it not only research destinations and book accommodations but also arrange transportation, make restaurant reservations, and even suggest activities based on your family's preferences.

This level of automation is made possible by the seamless integration of various services through the App SDK. Developers will be incentivized to create "apps" for this new ecosystem, allowing their services to be discoverable and usable by AI agents.

### Implications for the Digital Landscape

The potential ramifications of this shift are vast and could impact various stakeholders:

* **Users:** The primary benefit for users is a more streamlined and intuitive online experience. The cognitive load of navigating multiple websites and apps could be significantly reduced, making the internet more accessible and efficient.
* **Developers:** The Agent Kit and App SDK represent a significant opportunity for developers to create innovative new services and reach users in a new way. However, it also presents the challenge of adapting to a new platform and potentially a new set of rules dictated by OpenAI.
* **Businesses:** Companies will need to rethink their online presence, moving from a website-centric model to one that is "agent-friendly." This will likely involve developing APIs and creating "apps" for the ChatGPT ecosystem to ensure their services are accessible to AI agents.
* **The Web Itself:** The very structure of the internet could be transformed. The dominance of the web browser and the traditional website could wane as users increasingly interact with the digital world through conversational interfaces.

### The Road Ahead

While the vision of an agent-driven web is compelling, there are still significant hurdles to overcome. Issues of data privacy, security, and the potential for algorithmic bias will need to be carefully addressed. Furthermore, the success of this new ecosystem will depend on widespread adoption from both developers and users.

Nevertheless, OpenAI's recent announcements are a clear indication of its ambition to shape the future of the internet. By providing the tools to build and integrate intelligent agents, OpenAI is not just predicting the future; it is actively building it. The era of the agent-centric web may be closer than we think.
