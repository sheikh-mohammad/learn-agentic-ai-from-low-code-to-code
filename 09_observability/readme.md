# Session 9: Observability & Cost Control (No‑Code)

This session teaches you to build AI systems that monitor their own performance, collect user feedback, and improve over time—essential skills for production AI systems. 

## Why
You can’t improve what you can’t observe. Learn to read traces, find loops/dead ends, and reduce time/tokens.

## Objectives
- Inspect conversation/run traces to spot inefficiencies
- Identify tool‑call loops and dead ends
- Apply lightweight A/Bs and measure token/time savings

## Lab
1. Collect 10 real conversations; mark slow/failure points
2. Add a guard or instruction tweak; create variant B
3. Compare A vs. B on tokens, latency, pass rate

## Deliverable
- Before/after trace screenshots and a 1‑paragraph cost/latency write‑up

## The Self-Improving System Mindset

### Traditional Systems
```
Deploy → Monitor manually → Fix when broken → Update occasionally
```

### Self-Improving Systems
```
Deploy → Monitor → Learn from usage → Improve continuously → Evolve independently
```

**Key Insight:** Modern AI systems should improve themselves based on usage patterns, user feedback, and performance data.

### What to Monitor in AI Systems

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Response Time:** How quickly does the system respond?
- **Throughput:** How many requests can it handle?
- **Error Rate:** What percentage of requests fail?
- **Resource Usage:** CPU, memory, API calls consumed

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Accuracy Rate:** How often are responses correct?
- **Relevance Score:** How helpful are the responses?
- **Consistency:** How similar are responses to the same question?
- **User Satisfaction:** How happy are users with the experience?

**Business Metrics:**
- **Task Completion:** How often do users achieve their goals?
- **Cost per Interaction:** How much does each interaction cost?
- **ROI Tracking:** What value does the system provide?
- **Usage Patterns:** How and when do users interact with the system?
