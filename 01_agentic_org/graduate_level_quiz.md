# The Agentic Organization: A Graduate Level Assessment

**Instructions:** Please select the best possible answer for each of the following questions based on the concepts presented in the article.

**1. The McKinsey article posits that the agentic organization represents a paradigm shift comparable to the industrial and digital revolutions. What is the core principle that defines this new paradigm?**

A) The complete replacement of human hierarchical structures with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) managed entirely by AI.

B) A system where humans and AI agents, both virtual and physical, are integrated to collaborate on value creation at a near-zero marginal cost.

C) The augmentation of the existing digital enterprise with advanced AI tools that primarily focus on automating repetitive, low-skill tasks.

D) A cultural movement prioritizing human-centric design, with AI serving exclusively as a support tool for enhancing employee well-being.

**2. In the "bank of tomorrow" example provided, what is the primary function of the human employees within the agentic workflows?**
A) To directly handle all customer-facing interactions, using AI agents only for backend data processing and administrative support.

B) To act as the final point of approval for every transaction initiated by an AI agent, ensuring manual oversight for all processes.

C) To serve as supervisors and expert escalators, overseeing teams of AI agents and managing complex exceptions in the workflow.

D) To focus exclusively on developing and programming the AI agents, without direct involvement in the operational mortgage process itself.

**3. The article describes a spectrum of increasing complexity for the deployment of virtual AI agents. Which of the following represents the most advanced stage on this spectrum?**

A) The development of end-to-end workflow automation for specific, well-defined business processes.

B) The creation of entire "AI-first" agentic systems that form the core operational backbone of the organization.

C) The use of simple, specialized AI tools designed to augment and improve existing human-led activities.

D) The deployment of physical AI agents, such as drones and robots, to interface with the material world.

**4. According to the analysis, the agentic organization is constructed upon five fundamental pillars. Which of the following is NOT one of these pillars?**

A) Technology and data infrastructure.

B) Governance and risk management frameworks.

C) Marketing and external communications strategy.

D) The organizational business and operating models.

**5. How did the operating model of the industrial era primarily differ from the emerging agentic model?**

A) The industrial model prioritized mass customization and rapid product iteration, whereas the agentic model focuses on mass replication.

B) The industrial model was built on functional hierarchies and efficient scaling, while the agentic model is built on networks of human-agent teams.

C) The industrial model relied on a small, highly skilled workforce, while the agentic model utilizes a large, generalized labor force.

D) The industrial model emphasized decentralized decision-making, in contrast to the agentic model's centralized AI-driven command structure.

**6. What is a critical initial action the article recommends for executive leaders seeking to guide their company toward an agentic paradigm?**

A) Immediately launch a full-scale, company-wide restructuring of all departments to align with a theoretical agentic blueprint.

B) Secure a multi-year budget increase for the IT department to procure a wide variety of off-the-shelf AI software solutions.

C) Focus on short-term cost-cutting by identifying and replacing a significant percentage of the workforce with first-generation AI agents.

D) Rewire one or two strategic "lighthouse domains" to test agentic principles and begin upskilling the workforce in these targeted areas.

**7. The concept of an agentic organization involves both virtual and physical AI agents. What is the distinguishing role of physical AI agents?**

A) They are responsible for processing and analyzing the vast amounts of unstructured data required to train virtual AI agents.

B) Their primary function is to govern the interactions between different virtual AI agents to ensure they adhere to company policies.

C) They provide the "bodies" for AI, allowing artificial intelligence to directly interact with and manipulate the physical world.

D) They are exclusively designed for customer service interactions, providing a physical presence in retail and service environments.

**8. What fundamental element underpins the successful transition of a company's workforce, people, and culture into an agentic model?**

A) A strict, top-down enforcement of new policies and procedures to ensure rapid compliance with the new operating model.

B) Fostering a culture that embraces continuous learning, experimentation, and trust between human and AI collaborators.

C) The mandatory requirement for all employees, regardless of role, to acquire advanced coding and data science certifications.

D) Shifting the primary key performance indicators (KPIs) for all employees to be based solely on the adoption rate of new AI tools.

**9. The article implies that a key economic advantage of the agentic organization is its ability to scale at near-zero marginal cost. This is most directly achieved through:**

A) The reusability and instantaneous replication of skilled virtual agents across countless tasks without a proportional increase in labor costs.

B) The strategic reduction of investment in data and technology infrastructure, which are no longer critical in the new paradigm.

C) The elimination of the governance and compliance functions, which are fully automated and require no human or capital input.

D) A reliance on open-source AI models that require no licensing fees or development costs for the organization.

**10. How does the agentic paradigm propose to solve the challenge of information silos that often plague traditional organizations?**

A) By creating a central human authority with exclusive access to all data, who then delegates information access to teams as needed.

B) By implementing more rigid functional hierarchies to control the flow of information more effectively between departments.

C) By leveraging integrated AI systems that can access and synthesize information across the enterprise, providing a unified view for teams.

D) By physically co-locating all teams into a single open-plan office to encourage more frequent informal communication.
