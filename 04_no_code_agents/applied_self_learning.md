## Chapter 1 · Understanding Agents and Chatbots

### 1. Brief Theory Introduction

A chatbot gives single replies to single questions. It does not remember past messages or take extra steps. An agent is different. An agent follows several steps to accomplish a goal. It can remember past inputs, call tools, make decisions, and ask a human for help.

Agents help teams move faster. For example, Klarna built a support agent that now handles two-thirds of their customer chat requests. Agents can also scale personalized help. One agent can respond to many people at the same time while following policies.

### 2. Check the Basics

1. **Question:** What is the main job of a chatbot?  
   **Answer:** A chatbot answers one question at a time without remembering earlier steps.

2. **Question:** Name two abilities that make agents more powerful than chatbots.  
   **Answer:** Agents can remember past context and they can call tools or hand tasks to humans.

3. **Question:** Why do organizations care about human approvals in agent workflows?  
   **Answer:** Human approvals stop risky or wrong actions before the agent completes them.

### 3. Introduce Solved Problems

#### Solved Problem 1 · Mapping a Manual Process to an Agent Flow

**Scenario:** A help desk receives an email about a lost ID badge. The current steps are: read the email, check the policy document, write a reply, send the reply, log the request.

**Goal:** Turn this into an agent workflow.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify tasks.** The workflow includes classification, knowledge lookup, drafting a response, and logging.
2. **Assign agent actions.** The agent reads the request, classifies it as "badge issue," looks up the badge policy, drafts a reply, and logs the case.
3. **Assign human actions.** A security officer approves the response before it goes to the requester.
4. **Describe the agent flow.** Start → Agent reads message → Agent classifies request → Agent searches policy → Agent drafts reply → Human approves → Agent sends reply → Agent logs the case.
5. **Explain the benefit.** The team answers faster, and the security officer still keeps control.

#### Solved Problem 2 · Explaining Agents to Stakeholders

**Scenario:** A manager believes agents are only fancy chatbots.

**Goal:** Explain the difference.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Start with a chatbot example.** “When I ask our current chatbot ‘What is the refund policy?’ it replies with the policy text. That is all it can do.”
2. **Describe the agent example.** “Our new agent can take a whole return request. It reads the sender’s message, figures out if the request fits policy, drafts a response, asks a human to sign off, and logs the ticket.”
3. **Highlight features.** “That agent remembers the case, uses our tools, and knows when to send the issue to a manager. The chatbot cannot do that.”
4. **Close with value.** “Agents turn multi-step work into one experience while keeping humans in control.”

#### Solved Problem 3 · Building Confidence Before a Lab

**Scenario:** Students feel nervous about using Agent Builder without code.

**Goal:** Show them they already know enough.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Connect to what they know.** “You already understand basic workflows, like reading an email, checking a rule, and responding.”
2. **Show the agent canvas.** “Here is Start → Guardrail → Agent → Approval → End. Each box represents one of those steps.”
3. **Reveal drag-and-drop.** Demonstrate dragging a node onto the canvas.
4. **Summarize.** “If you can draw the steps on paper, you can build them on the Agent Builder canvas.”

### 4. Assign Practice Problems

1. Write a short paragraph explaining why agents need to remember past messages.
2. List three tasks in your daily work or school life that could benefit from an agent.
3. On paper, draw a simple agent flow for handling a classroom question.

### 5. Challenge with Advanced Questions

1. Critique the statement: “Human approvals slow agents down, so we should remove them.”
2. Design a policy for when an agent must ask a human for help in a financial context.

## Chapter 3 · Working with Nodes in Agent Builder

### 1. Brief Theory Introduction

Agent Builder uses nodes to represent steps in a workflow. You connect nodes to define the agent’s logic. There are five categories:

- **Core Nodes** — Start, Agent, Note.
- **Tool Nodes** — File Search, Guardrails, MCP.
- **Logic Nodes** — If/Else, While, Human Approval.
- **Data Nodes** — Transform, Set State.
- **Connector Nodes** — Configurations tied to data or tools.

### 2. Check the Basics

1. **Question:** Which node begins every workflow?  
   **Answer:** The Start node.

2. **Question:** What does the Guardrails node do?  
   **Answer:** It checks inputs or outputs for safety and signals pass or fail.

3. **Question:** When would you use a Set State node?  
   **Answer:** When you want to store a value for later steps in the workflow.

### 3. Introduce Solved Problems

## Chapter 4 · Safety, Guardrails, and Governance

### 1. Brief Theory Introduction

Safety matters when agents interact with people and data. Common risks include prompt injection, data leakage, and unintended actions. Guardrails, human approvals, and clear instructions help reduce these risks. Governance means having policies, logs, and reviews to keep systems trustworthy.

### 2. Check the Basics

1. **Question:** What is prompt injection?  
   **Answer:** Prompt injection is when untrusted input tries to change the agent’s instructions to make it do harmful actions.

2. **Question:** How does PII masking protect users?  
   **Answer:** PII masking hides private information so the agent does not reveal it in outputs.

3. **Question:** Why do we log agent activity?  
   **Answer:** Logs help us review decisions, investigate issues, and prove compliance.

### 3. Introduce Solved Problems

#### Solved Problem 1 · Guardrail Strategy for a Health Agent

**Scenario:** A healthcare agent should never expose patient identification numbers.

**Goal:** Apply guardrails to block exposure.

**Step-by-step Solution:**
