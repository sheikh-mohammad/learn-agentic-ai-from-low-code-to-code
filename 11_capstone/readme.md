# Session 11: Capstone Build & Publish

This final session brings together everything you've learned to build a production-ready, self-extending AI application that can modify and improve itself based on natural language requests.

## Why
Ship a usable agent, close the quality loop, and document a safe rollout.

## Objectives
- Finalize workflow and ChatKit UI
- Run evals and harden guardrails
- Write a Launch Note (scope, metrics, SLAs, rollback)

## Lab
1. Polish instructions, branding, and approvals
2. Run final eval; attach report and trace links
3. Publish ChatKit; invite 3 pilot testers

## Deliverable
- 5‑minute live demo and a Launch Note with 14‑day iteration plan
