**Time:** 1 week
**For:** Everyone (grade 10 students to professionals)

---

## What You'll Do?

Find ONE real company or workflow where agentic AI is being used right now. Research it. Understand it. Explain it simply.

That's it.

---

## Step 1: Find a Real Use Case

- Research of a niche or company where agentic ai is used in real life.
- Search: "[Company name] AI agent" or "[Company name] automation"
- Look for news articles, blog posts, YouTube videos

**Your task:** Pick ONE and write down:
- Company name
- What problem they had
- What the agent does
- Where you found this information (link or source)

---

## Step 2: Research Deep

For your chosen use case, find answers to these 5 simple questions:

### Question 1: What Was the Problem?
**Write 2-3 sentences answering:**
- What task was taking lots of time/money before?
- How many people were doing this manually?
- What was costing the company?

Example: "Amazon warehouse workers were manually moving packages across the warehouse. This took 8 hours per person per day. The company needed to move packages faster without hiring more workers."

---

### Question 2: What Agent Did They Build?
**Write 2-3 sentences answering:**
- What does the agent do (be specific)?
- What inputs does it get (what information)?
- What outputs does it create (what does it do)?

Example: "Amazon robots navigate warehouse floors using cameras and sensors. They receive instructions like 'go to shelf B-42 and pick up package #1234.' They move to that location, pick up the package, and bring it to the packing station."

---

### Question 3: How Do Humans Stay in Control?
**Write 2-3 sentences answering:**
- Do humans still make decisions?
- What do humans check or approve?
- What happens if something goes wrong?

Example: "Robots follow programmed routes and safety rules. Humans monitor the robots on screens and can stop them if there's a problem. If a robot gets stuck, a human takes over and helps it."

---

### Question 4: What Results Did They Get?
**Write 2-3 sentences answering:**
- What improved? (speed, cost, quality, etc.)
- By how much? (Give numbers if you can find them)
- How did this help the business?

Example: "Amazon moved 50% more packages with the same number of workers. Each robot can move 300 packages per day. This saved the company millions in labor costs."

---

### Question 5: Why Did This Work?
**Write 2-3 sentences answering:**
- Why was this job good for an agent?
- What made it easier/harder than other tasks?
- Would this work for other companies?

Example: "Warehouse work is repetitive — pick, move, drop. This is perfect for agents because the instructions are clear. Agents don't get tired. Any warehouse could use this."
