# 💬 **Standard Feedback Framework**

When grading this assignment, use structured, balanced feedback — both **overall comments** and **per-criterion notes**.

---

### ✨ **1. Strengths (Positive Feedback)**

Highlight what the student did well:

> 🌟 “You chose an excellent real-world use case (Salesforce Einstein). The explanation is clear and understandable — great job simplifying technical details.”
> 🌟 “Your summary is well-structured and includes a proper public LinkedIn post — this shows initiative.”

---

### ⚙️ **2. Areas for Improvement (Constructive Feedback)**

Point out what can be improved, framed positively:

> ⚠️ “You described the problem well, but the ‘results’ section could use real numbers or measurable outcomes.”
> ⚠️ “The explanation is good, but you missed a link to your source — please include one for verification.”
> ⚠️ “Try simplifying your language so a Grade 10 student can follow the explanation easily.”

---

### 🚀 **3. Actionable Suggestions (Next Steps)**

Give clear next steps:

> 💡 “Next time, try comparing this agentic use case with one from a different industry — it helps deepen understanding.”
> 💡 “Add a short paragraph about what *you* learned from this research — it shows reflection.”
